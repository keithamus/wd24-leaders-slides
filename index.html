          <h1>Software Crisis</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            In 1968, NATO hosted a software development conference to address what was deemed a Software Crisis at the
            time. Increasing complexity of hardware meant that software projects were often overbudget, over time,
            inneficient to build, maintain and run. Sound familiar? They gathered prominent software developers of the
            time, such as Edsgar Dijkstra and Doug Mcillroy to present on ways to solve these issues.

            Mcillroy presented a talk on Mass produced software components, proposing that, much like hardware, the
            software industry should be able to produce reusable parts to build software cheaper, faster, and easier.
            <br><br>
            Or as mcilroy put it software engineers could "consult a catalogue offering routines in varying degrees of
            precision, robust- ness, time-space performance, and generality".

          <h1>How does this apply today?</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            I don't think Mcilroy was talking about components in the same sense we do today, I think he was talking
            about libraries, and decomposable systems. Composable primitives. Mcilroy worked at Bell Labs on the unix
            operating system, which embodied these ideas. 
            <br><br>
            But why am I talking about a conf talk that happened over 50 years ago?
            <br><br>
            Well these are the same ideas that exist throughout the industry, including UI and the Web. 
            Mcillroy's talk focused around the growing complexity of hardware, moving from vaccum tubes to mainframes,
            but we're experiencing the same increase in complexity of hardware as more software development pivots from
            desktop to mobile, new user interface paradigms, new input devices like touch, vision.
            <br><br>
            The problem is we're putting so much energy into building these experiences over and over, I think this is
            down to a failure of the web platform.

          <h1>The Web Platform</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            In terms of a decomposable system, the Web Platform has historically struggled. It gives us the bedrock for
            which to place our libraries and components atop, but it hasn't always composed very well, and so we
            essentially ship our own web platforms on top of the web platform.
            <br><br>
            The Web at its inception in 1990, it was just for documents. The system wasn't designed for apps, just pages.
            <br><br>
            And so the history goes; the 2000s however, there was a big push to create richer documents and applications 
            using the Web. The W3C was excited about this new XML format they'd invented but meanwhile browser companies
            like Opera, Apple, Mozilla and even Google wanted to focus on innovating and evolving the web as it stood.
            HTML5, CSS2, Google Chrome. Engines got faster and started a benchmark race with sunspider, kraken, octane.
            Loosely this falls under the web 2.0 umbrella.

            So one way to look at these decades is 1990s was the rise of the document, while 2000s was the rise of the
            app. 2001 saw the release of the iphone which enabled these new experiences on the web change happened at 
            a rapid pace.

            This problem was kind of unique to the 2010s, which became decade of innovation through experimentation of
            JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Each of this new libraries brought their own paradigms of how to build
            apps and organise code. They filled the gaps missing in the platform.
            <br><br>
            But they've also veered toward a convergance. While they all originally offered something quite different in
            their inception, many have converged around a handful of major patterns.
            <br><br>
            The rise of JavaScript and this struggle for a decomposable web platform gave rise to these frameworks but 
            the costs have not been properly realised; their are externalised costs which have yet to be realised.
            Browsers have become vessels for this JS virtual machine and little else, and so little of the platform is
            actually used, it seems. 
            <br><br>
            This cost, the cost of compute and the cost of network get pushed onto our users; it's not just about data
            deserts or fringe users who disable JS. I don't need to tell Australians about the latency of servers hosted 
            in us-east-1; the speed of light is bound by the laws of physics.
            <br><br>
            But also theres a misinterpretation of moore's law, we're not getting better phones which lessen the cost of
            this. Alex Russel's work speaks more to this but our devices aren't getting faster, there's just more of them.
            If you have an iphone in your pocket you're part of the elite, your device is many times faster than the
            median, and the median is flatlining.
            <br><br>
            Scaling to your next zero, your next order of magnitude of users, gets more difficult as you dive into this 
            long tail and the costs are more acutely evident. If this is alien to you, you might not be measuring the 
            right things.
            <br><br>
            Your technical teams might be talking about SSR vs client side rendering, especially due to the costs of good
            sold on the server, but this is yet more user experience arbitrage, to avoid the real problem we need to talk
            about which is the cost of this JS.

            So going back to our mapping of decades, maybe the 2010s could be documented as the era of the frameworks
            that scaffolded an architecture around our codebases, exploring how best to fill the gaps of the platform. 
            <br><br>
            What is the result of this? Are we going to keep this frankly obnoxious complexity around forever? I think
            the convergance lets us see a path forward where leveraging the platform can help us lower our dependency
            on such high cost patterns and get more for free.

            2013 was somewhat an epochial moment for the web, perhaps our 1960s software crisis. In 2013 members of the
            W3 cosigned to tighten the feedback loop between platform development and the industry, by allowing newer
            low level primitives to serve as building blocks as new experiences and decompose large systems into
            <strong>components</strong> that helped explain how the pieces got put together.
            <br><br>
            And so while innovation in userland progressed with frameworks browsers have been getting more capable to
            address these needs.

          <aside class="notes">
            So the fruits of the exensible web manifesto lead to many new innovations in the browser:
            <br><br>
            Service workers to control the network<br>
            New input apis like pointer events<br>
            Low level APIs like web usb<br>
            Additionally exposing features that browsers have had internally such as the observer APIs<br>
            New exploratory APIs like CSS Houdini and the paint APIs.<br>
            The list goes on. One big addition around this time was the Web Components APIs, allowing
            developers to extend HTML elements into their own custom widgets. This arguably solved the View part of the
            Model-View paradigm.

            But views are nothing without their models, and one of the more disappointing failures of this era was
            Object.observe. This was designed around the idea of tracking object mutations. You'd pass an object. The
            model, for the view. It was ultimately deemed too complex and not the right fit when it came to framework
            use, and so frameworks live on, unable to be dethroned...

            Meanwhile frontend frameworks were converging around one pattern of reactive Observables for managing state.
            Frameworks like Angular, and libraries, rxjs, mobx, have all converged on this idea of Reactive programming.
            <br><br>
            The idea of bringing this into the platform has been kicked around since 2015, at various standard groups

            But if we look at the top frameworks by popularity, a lot of them have also converged on other find
            grained reactivity primitives, otherwise known as Signals. Aside from React, all the major frameworks
            have converged around Signals for state management.
            <br><br>
            Svelte calls them Runes, Ember calls them computed properties, but they're the same thing. Unless you're
            React, signals is the Model part of the view problem. Even React has integrations of signal-like
            libraries: Recoil, Jotai.

            But now there's also an effort to standardise these at TC39, to specify this built-in to the language.
            Members of popular frameworks like Angular, Ember, Preact, QWIK, Solid, Svelte, Vue, and more are all
            collaborating on building out a universal protocol for Signals that will be baked into the language.

            There's nascent discussions and proposals around integrating data mutations right into HTML too, with

            I'm not going to go into too much detail but you can dive into the proposal on the QR code.

            This is more a vision of the future; where data binding becomes an intrinsic part of HTML. All of the

            Going back to the 2000s though, we also saw the industry maturing in design. "Design Patterns" and
            "Design Systems" that evolved from branding guidelines and brand identity. UI libraries like YUI and
            jQuery UI popularised this idea of off-the-shelf component libraries that have now extended into the
            design systems where we see branding and interactivity combined, into a new vernacular with which 
            applications speak to their users.

            And we can't talk design without talking about CSS, which has also made huge strides at catching up to
            the innovation of the decade; not just the language through features like variables and nesting, but
            also whole new technological advancements like View Transitions that allow for declaring transitions
            between pages to create seamless experiences, blurring the line between MPA and SPA, if there ever was
            a line in the first place.

            But design systems aren't just about styling pages or branding them to a companies colour pallete. It is
            about creating that language of interactivity. Something like Google's Material design system is arguably
            the most used because it coincides with the design language of the android operating system. Systems like
            Material design have invented new paradigms of interactivity like the floating action button.
            <br><br>
            But again these come at high operational cost. Big companies are pouring millions of dollars into these
            libraries and these teams continuously firefight for their positions, as rigour goes up the team finds it
            harder to deliver at the pace of application engineering, because they're solving for the whole problem
            space, reinventing the wheel over and over.

            In 2019 when Microsoft switched Edge from using the EdgeHTML & Chakra to using Chromium, Greg Witworth
            lead the forms team to restyling and modernising some of the available form controls. The improvements
            were soreley needed, but also subtle. They solved key accessibility issues and gave us more tolerable

            At the same time as improving the basics, Greg founded the Open-UI Community Group. An initiative to look
            at how we can close the gap on components like we have done other technologies.
            <br><br>
            By far and away the largest source of frustration when developing form controls has been the select element.
            So we asked ourselves: why are people rebuilding select? What are they trying to get from it? How can we
            decompose select to its constituent parts so that there is less re-work across the industry.

          <aside class="notes">
            And so there's been a huge amount of research gathering information on all the components all of these
            design systems are building, and cataloguing it, figuring out the missing pieces, and attempting to
            add them back in.

          <aside class="notes">
            The result is a journey of breaking down anatomy of a select and creating new capabilities so that it's
            easier to customise the built-in select but also easier to create your own variants. We've been slowly
            extending what's possible with select with small incremental changes, such as allowing hr in selects.

            And so we're working on a way where you can inject different pieces of HTML to replace bits of the
            select element. Want a custom button? Stick a button tag inside a select. Want to customise the selected
            option text? The new selectedoption element will act as that placeholder. Datalist will drive the custom
            container, we're extending options to have images, systemtically addressing all of the pain points raised
            by design systems and developers. And select is just the first, in this journey.

            This should not require pulling in 30kb of JavaScript to make happen. At worst this should be a few hundred

            But it's not just about extending what's there, it's also about providing the base primitives to allow for
            rolling your own versions easier. Popover allows you to create floating UI which sits above all content on
            the page on something called the top-layer, and is immune to overflow, positioning, or z-index issues that
            is common when creating this kind of UI. It eliminates the need for globs of JavaScript, even the opener
            buttons are declarative, meaning you get accessibility for free too!
            <br><br>
            If you've ever used something like React Portals; you can stop, popover solves this problem. RIP React
            Portals we hardly knew ye.
            <br><br>
            And this isn't just contrived code, this works today - this markup is accessible! No aria-details needed,
            no focus management, it does it all for you!

            This is usable today. In fact you've probably used it without knowing it; we've been migrating all of the
            floating UI at GitHub to using popovers and dialogs and it's literally making 1000s of lines of code

            So for me, I look at the work that has been done and will be done, and I see a bit of a renaissance on
            the web platform. I think while 2010s were a period of discovery and a huge growth period for frameworks,
            I see the coming decades as a return to form.
            <br><br>
            I see the 2020s as something of a re-alignment to the platform. I think we'll see a decline of framework
            moats, meanwhile the web platform will encompass more of the value add that current frameworks provide.
            <br><br>
            And I think as we close out the decade and all of these technologies are enshrined into the platform and
            widely available, into the 2030s we might see a jQuery moment for frameworks; they'll likely continue to
            innovate but I think there will be less compelling reason to bring in all the client side JS and the Web
            Platform will be seen more as the framework that it is. Perhaps in response we'll see more of a shift to
            the server for these things, and that's maybe another talk brewing...

            the cost of your platform, finding the hidden externalised costs, costs of goods sold and the scalability

            But there's readily available pieces for you to poise yourself ready for the next decades, tech like
            popovers and view transitions reduce the gap between the value a frameworks provide. Signals and Observables
